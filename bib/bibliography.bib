  abstract = {The fast changes of technologies in todays information landscape
	have considerably shortened the lifespan of digital objects. Digital
	preservation has become a pressing challenge. Different strategies
	such as migration and emulation have been proposed; however, the
	decision for a specific tool e.g. for format migration or an emulator
	is very complex. The process of evaluating potential solutions against
	specific requirements and building a plan for preserving a given
	set of objects is called preservation planning. So far, it is a mainly
	manual, sometimes ad-hoc process with little or no tool support.
	This paper presents a service-oriented architecture and decision
	support tool that implements a solid preservation planning process
	and integrates services for content characterisation, preservation
	action and automatic object comparison to provide maximum support
	for preservation planning endeavours.},

  abstract = {<p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play a prominent role in
	modern genetics. Current genotyping technologies such as Sequenom
	iPLEX, ABI TaqMan and KBioscience KASPar made the genotyping of huge
	SNP sets in large populations straightforward and allow the generation
	of hundreds of thousands of genotypes even in medium sized labs.
	While data generation is straightforward, the subsequent data conversion,
	storage and quality control steps are time-consuming, error-prone
	and require extensive bioinformatic support. In order to ease this
	tedious process, we developed SNPflow. SNPflow is a lightweight,
	intuitive and easily deployable application, which processes genotype
	data from Sequenom MassARRAY (iPLEX) and ABI 7900HT (TaqMan, KASPar)
	systems and is extendible to other genotyping methods as well. SNPflow
	automatically converts the raw output files to ready-to-use genotype
	lists, calculates all standard quality control values such as call
	rate, expected and real amount of replicates, minor allele frequency,
	absolute number of discordant replicates, discordance rate and the
	p-value of the HWE test, checks the plausibility of the observed
	genotype frequencies by comparing them to HapMap/1000-Genomes, provides
	a module for the processing of SNPs, which allow sex determination
	for DNA quality control purposes and, finally, stores all data in
	a relational database. SNPflow runs on all common operating systems
	and comes as both stand-alone version and multi-user version for
	laboratory-wide use. The software, a user manual, screenshots and
	a screencast illustrating the main features are available at <ext-link
